    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Bishop David O. Oyedepo received a call into the ministry through a heavenly vision, where he saw a lineup of battered, beaten, tattered, deformed, groaning for escape. He began sobbing with them. In response to his question, ‘but why Lord?’ God answered, “But from the beginning it was not so, and now the hour has come to liberate the whole world from all oppression of the devil through the preaching of the word of faith and I AM sending you to undertake this task.” Today, he stands as an Apostle of Faith to the nations, the impact of whose ministry has continued to spread across many nations of the world.

                  God commissioned the presiding Bishop of this commission with a Word of Faith ministry to our generation. Remember Paul said, <em>"...if the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle?"</em> (1 Cor 14:8) As a Commission, we have experienced amazing testimonies ever since this commission was handed down - that is over thirty years now! The Holy Ghost further inspired the servant of God, Dr. David Oyedepo, to classify the Word of Faith He has committed into his hands into the specific areas of emphasis, in direct response to Isaiah 40:6, <em>"The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry?..."</em> He has named these 12 areas of emphasis as the 12 Pillars of our Commission. We have crossed Jordan into power, bearing the ark of liberation. Here are the 12 stones, after the order of Joshua 4:1-8, 20-24. Having stood firm upon these twelve stones! And they have resulted in breakthroughs - both for the ministry and all that are partakers with us, of the same grace.
